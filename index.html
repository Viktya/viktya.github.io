            <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
            <h2>So, what do you do?</h2>
            <p>
                Well, I'm kind of nobody right now, and clearing the mess I put myself in.
                I don't have many plans besides from that, I can't focus on many things.
            </p>
            <h2>I see... what about your useful skills?</h2>
            <p>
                I started as an artist, I went to art school to draw, ended into graphics
                but it didn't do for me. Thanks to that I learned how to use Adobe's programs
                and I started drawing with a graphic tablet. Mainly elves, no questions.
                Then I tried ending my school career with IT, it didn't go well too,
                bright side: I got the basics. I don't have much on myself and I'm improving that.
                I found out I can learn pretty fast if I try, so I'm open to stuff.
